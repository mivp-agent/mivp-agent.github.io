If you are new and looking for resources on this checkout their homepage . Consider completing the labs associated with MIT 2.680 if you are really serious in your goal to learn MOOS-IvP. Purpose of pEpisodeManager In training of ML agents it is often desirable to split training experience into episodes that end in either success or failure. pEpisodeManager provides the capability to reset vehicles when some conditions are meet. This prevents the need to shutdown the vehicle between episodes (a expensive process). The demo below shows pEpisodeManager running during training of an agent in the AgentAquaticus mission. This mission is configured to reset agents to their home flag when they successfully capture the flag OR when they go out of bounds. Configuration There are four main components to configuring a instance of pEpisodeManager. Reset position Configuring success conditions Configuring failure conditions Reset position Note Currently, the only supported reset depth is 0. MOOS-IvP Agent is not currently compatible with submersible missions. For the basic functionality of pEpisodeManager to work, you must tell the manager where to reset the vehicle when. The following config block shows the proper usage of the reset_pos config variable where x=50 , y=-24 , and heading=240 . ProcessConfig = pEpisodeManager { AppTick = 4 CommsTick = 4 reset_pos = 50,-24,240 } If the following pEpisodeManager was started it would not reset the vehicle as it does not know when to do so. See bellow for configuration of success and failure conditions. Success & failure conditions For the manager to know when it should reset the vehicle (or equivalently when episodes should end), we need to do one of two things. Specify configuration variables for success & failure conditions. Trigger reset directly via a post to the EPISODE_MGR_CTRL moos var. This section will follow the configuration method. See below for the usage of EPISODE_MGR_CTRL. Reminder For pEpisodeManager to have access to a MOOS var it must either originate from an app also running on that vehicle or be forwarded from another vehicle. Forwarding is usually done via uFldNodeBroker or uFldShoreBroker . The following configuration block is made for Project Aquaticus and shows proper usage of the end_success_condition and end_failure_condition . The resulting behavior will be for the vehicle to reset when either tagged or in possession of the virtual flag. ProcessConfig = pEpisodeManager { AppTick = 4 CommsTick = 4 end_success_condition = (HAS_FLAG = true) end_failure_condition = (TAGGED = true) reset_pos = 50,-24,240 } More complex conditions can be specified using this format . If multiple end_success_condition or end_failure_condition lines are specified then pEpisodeManager will treat the relationship between them as an AND clause. State Transition Posts There are three state transitions which can be configured to post specified MOOS vars. The following config block shows the correct usage of the configuration variables. ProcessConfig = pEpisodeManager { AppTick = 4 CommsTick = 4 end_success_condition = (HAS_FLAG = true) end_failure_condition = (TAGGED = true) reset_pos = 50,-24,240 start_post = var=MY_VAR,val=now_starting reset_post = var=UNTAG_REQUEST,val=vname=$(VNAME) reset_post = var=MY_VAR,val=now_resetting pause_post = var=MY_VAR,val=now_pausing } TODO: Explain TODO: Max duration State & Transitions Overview There are four states which pEpisodeManager can be in. These states will be posted to the EPISODE_MGR_STATE MOOS var - RUNNING This is the main state, where MOOS variables are consumed to check if either end_success_condition s or end_failure_conditions s are satisfied at which point a state transition to STOPPING_HELM is triggered. Alternatively the vehicle can be reset through the EPISODE_MGR_STATE or by reaching the max_duration specified in the config. - STOPPING_HELM This state is used to wait for the IVPHELM_STATE MOOS var to enter the PARK state indicating that the vehicle will not be attempting to navigate during which is useful for the next state RESETING . - RESETING (working on the spelling) This state is used to wait for the vehicles NAV_X and NAV_Y to be in some tolerance of the configured reset_pos . After this condition is meet pEpisodeManager will check if a pause has been requested by use of EPISODE_MGR_STATE see here . If a pause has been requested the next state will be PAUSED and otherwise it will continue to the RUNNING state. - PAUSED Used to stop keep vehicles stopped until a EPISODE_MGR_CTRL post is made indicating that it should be started and transition to the RUNNING state. Using EPISODE_MGR_CTRL It can be useful to manually trigger state change in pEpisodeManager via a MOOS var post. For this reason pEpisodeManager listens on the EPISODE_MGR_CTRL variable. There are three \"actions\" which can be triggered via this method. start : Used when pEpisodeManager is in the PAUSED state to transition to RUNNING . hardstop : Immediately stop the current episode and enter the PAUSED state after resetting. Will report the episode as a failure in the episode report. reset : Immediately end the current episode. The state of success / failure can be set in the EPISODE_MGR_CTRL post. pause : After the current episode ends, enter the PAUSED state. These actions can be triggered by making a post where type= is followed by one of these action's names. For example, the following command uses the uPokeDB utility to make post causing the pEpisodeManager to come to a paused state after the current episode. uPokeDB alpha.moos EPISODE_MGR_CTRL=type=pause The reset can take an additional argument which specifies what value should be reported for the success state. uPokeDB alpha.moos EPISODE_MGR_CTRL=type=pause,success=true The MissionMessage python wrapper provides a pythonic way of trigging these posts. Episode Reports To report of the success / failure of each episode pEpisodeManager will post to the EPISODE_MGR_REPORT a comma separated key/value pairs. This are also helpful for debugging. The bellow is an example of one such report. NUM=8,SUCCESS=true,DURATION=122.0297,WILL_PAUSE=false These reports are automatically forwarded by BHV_Agent without any need for further configuration.

This parameter, among other things, will determine the starting position of the vehicle. role : Can take on the value of agent or drone . Determines what if BHV_Agent will be spawned on the vehicle. id : Currently values 11-15 and 21-25 (inclusive) are supported for agent s and drone s respectively these, along with role, determine the vname of the vehicle. Vehicles will only be able to tag a vehicle with corresponding least significant digit (e.g. drone_21 can tag agent_11 and not agent_12 ) Note In coming updates the BHV_Agent behavior will be started on both agent and drone roles. There are a number of helpful optional parameters some of which are highlighted below. --log : Enables the writing of MOOS-IvP log files. Useful during debugging. --color=<my_color> : Used to change the color of the vehicle when rendered via pMarineViewer --behavior=<behavior_name> : Used to set initial behavior for drones. Any value placed here will show up in the ACTION field in the meta_heron.bhv file. Time Warp : A integer value with how many times the simulation should be speed up relative to real world time. Note The time warp of vehicles should correspond. Example agent launch ./launch_heron.sh red agent 11 --color=orange 10 Example drone launch ./launch_heron.sh blue drone 21 --behavior=DEFEND --color=orange 10 Launching shoreside At least one shoreside is required as it acts as the bridge for vehicle communication and manages the flag capture / tagging. Shore side takes only optional parameters. --no_gui : Used to disable the launch of pMarineViewer as it can slow the simulation. Time Warp : See vehicle launch section. Example shoreside launch ./launch_shoreside.sh --no_gui 10 Vehicle Overview Behaviors MOOS-IvP behaviors are what should determine the actions of a robot. These can either be what are referred to as \"hard coded behaviors\" or those that are produced by BHV_Agent . If extending the behavior file please use this page as a reference. Note Currently the BHV_Agent behavior is always running when the MODE == ACTIVE . This important as this contains the code which communicates with python. For hard coded behaviors, the below config block shows that anytime the ACTION != AGENT (as set when role is set to agent in the launch script) and MODE == ACTIVE the vehicle will return to their flag when they either have the flag or are tagged. set MODE = RETURN_BASE { MODE = ACTIVE (ACTION != AGENT) and ((HAS_FLAG = true) or (TAGGED = true)) } PLAY Otherwise a number of MODE s can be selected depending on the ACTION value: ATTACKING , ATTACK_LEFT , ATTACK_RIGHT , DEFENDING , STATIONING For more information see the current meta_heron.bhv and reference the IvP Helm wiki page's left hand side bar. pEpisodeManager The mission's pEpisodeManager is configured in this file and currently looks for the TAGGED == true condition for failure and receives success signals by means of a EPISODE_MGR_CTRL post from uFldFlagManagerAgent Shoreside overview The shoreside uses uFldFlagManagerAgent and uFldTagManagerAgent to allows for multi vehicle training.","title":"AgentAquaticus"},{"location":"moos_ivp/missions/agent_aquaticus/#agentaquaticus","text":"AgentAquaticus is a fork of the Aquaticus mission which integrates the moos-ivp-agent project and provides for the ability to train multiple agents at once with one instance of a MOOS-IvP shoreside.
